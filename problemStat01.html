      <p><b>Now in Android: Episode #1</b></p>
            One of my favorite things about the Android team is that we are all so enthusiastic about the technology we work on and about helping developers use it that we push information of all kinds (libraries, articles, samples, codelabs, videos, tweets, blogs, etc.) constantly and independently. Which is… awesome; I much prefer this model to one where everything goes through some sort of corporate funnel, resulting in a slow drip-drip-drip of formal, company-sanctioned artifacts.

      <p><b>Introduction to Android development</b></p>
      Android is a popular computing platform based on the Linux® operating system. The initial commercial version of Android hit the market in 2008 in the form of a mobile phone platform, back when the most popular cell phone for a business user was the BlackBerry, when the iPhone was beginning to make meaningful waves across all sectors, and when the majority of phone users were still tapping out texts from a flip phone.
